# Python-VM
Welcome to my Python VM - complete with a bytecode compiler! As a way to learn the inner workings of compiling, interpreting, and stack memory allocation, this is an expandable system to safely run python runtime environments and have better package management with pip.

## Expected Features
- Python-Bytecode compiler
- Virtual Machine for runtime environment
- Just-in-time compilation accessory
- Peephole Optimizer
- Garbage Collector
